## ðŸš€ **Next Steps: RunPod Full Experiments**

### **Immediate Actions:**

1. **Upload to RunPod:**
   ```powershell
   scp .\transfer_out_books.zip runpod@<YOUR_POD_HOST>:~/recrl/
   ```

2. **Run Full Experiments:**
   ```bash
   # On RunPod:
   cd ~/recrl
   unzip -o transfer_out_books.zip -d restore
   chmod +x scripts/run_runpod_full.sh
   ./scripts/run_runpod_full.sh
   ```

### **What the Full Experiments Will Give You:**

#### **Main Experiment (Shielded RecRL):**
- **Model:** GPT-J-6B with 4-bit quantization
- **Training:** 20,000 PPO steps with RecSim-NG
- **Expected:** CTRâ†‘, NDCG flat (shielding works)

#### **Ablation Studies:**
1. **No Projection** â†’ NDCG/CTR degradation
2. **KL=0** â†’ verbosity/drift effects
3. **LoRA rank 4** â†’ parameter efficiency
4. **Longer explanations** â†’ quality trade-offs

#### **Safety Audits:**
- Toxicity evaluation
- Popularity bias analysis
- Privacy checks

### **Expected Outputs:**
- `experiments/aggregate_results.csv` - All metrics in one table
- `experiments/figs/` - Plots showing CTRâ†‘ and NDCG flat
- `code/audit/outputs/` - Safety evaluation reports

## ðŸ“Š **For Your Paper**

### **Results You'll Have:**
- **Table 1:** Main results (CTRâ†‘, NDCG flat)
- **Table 2:** Ablation studies comparison
- **Figure 1:** CTR vs training steps
- **Figure 2:** NDCG stability over time
- **Figure 3:** Ablation comparison bars
- **Section 9:** Safety audit findings

### **Methods Section:**
- LoRA rank: 16 (main), 4 (ablation)
- KL Î²: 0.05 (main), 0.0 (ablation)
- Model: GPT-J-6B with 4-bit quantization
- Sequence lengths: 384/160 (main), 512/320 (long ablation)
- Micro-batch: 4, gradient accumulation: 2

## ðŸŽ¯ **Success Criteria**

The experiments are successful if:
- âœ… CTR trends upward during training
- âœ… NDCG@10 stays relatively flat (shielding works)
- âœ… No-projection ablation shows degradation
- âœ… All ablations complete without errors
- âœ… Audit reports are generated

## ðŸš€ **Ready to Launch!**

**Your local smoke test has proven that all components work correctly. The full experiments on RunPod will give you the quantitative results needed for your paper's tables, figures, and analysis.**

**Everything is prepared and tested. You're ready to run the full Shielded RecRL experiments and get the results for your paper!** ðŸŽ¯
